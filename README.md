# To make an icon using these tools

1. Find the icon you want to use from Wowhead.
2. Resize it to 23x23 pixels
3. Copy it into iconfoundation.gif (after increasing the color depth)
4. Modify the text in "text template.pspimage" (using Paint Shop Pro)
5. Resize the text to something like 27 or 25 pixels wide.
6. Copy the text into the iconfoundation image, and save the new icon.

Eventually, I should automate this entire process:

1) Upload image
2) Choose text
3) Generated
